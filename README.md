## Important Notes
- **Not Production-Ready**:
  - This product is currently not suitable for production use.

  - The application works well for development and testing purposes but may fail in production environments due to CAPTCHA restrictions.

## Development Instructions
1. Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally or on a server.
2. Update the `appsettings.json` file with your MongoDB connection details:

```json
{
  "MongoDbConfig": {
    "DatabaseName": "seo_db",
    "Server": "localhost",
    "Port": 27017,
    "User": "",
    "EncryptedPassword": ""
  }
}
```
3. Run the application and execute tests to verify functionality.

## Future Improvements
- Investigate and implement solutions to handle Google's CAPTCHA challenges.
- Enhance test coverage for edge cases and error handling.
